The only sin in this world of pain
In this world of shame
In this world of heartache

The only sin in this world unjust
In this world of lust
In this world distrusting

The only sin in this world corrupt
Where passions erupt
And end abrupt it's a crime
With no great gestures cry
Its eyes, with no great evils shine

Here among all the vicious beasts
With their blood lust feast
Ordained by black priests

Here among the poison viper's bite
A police gunfight
In the unknown night is a man
With no great master plan
No deadly weapon clutching in his hand

You'll never see the light
In the darkest night
Never see the light
Never see the light
When the boredom comes

You'll never see the light
In the darkest night
Never see the light
Never see the light
When the boredom comes
If you're one of the boring ones

The only crime in this violent place
With lies two faced
Where loves disgraceful

Crimes committed with sharpened knives
And wasted lives
Of those who are forced to shove
And murder the peace dove
There is no higher calling from above

You'll never see the light
Quell this appetite
Never see the light
Never see the light
When the boredom comes

You'll never see the light
Quell this appetite
Never see the light
Never see the light
When the boredom comes
When you're one of the boring ones

All right
