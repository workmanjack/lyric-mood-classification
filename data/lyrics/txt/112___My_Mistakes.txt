[Chorus:]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me

[Verse:]
What's wrong with me
Why can't I do right
You promise me
You give me a life
If I could be
Well then just a typical
Guy to lie to your face
How could I do
The things that I say I wouldn't do
Keep doing the same
I give you
Might just too pitiful
To recognize your worth

Now you tell me that before
Promise that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you
But what did I go do
And everytime I had the chance
To get into another nigga woman's pants
I would follow through
Not thinking of me and you

[Chorus:]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me

[Verse 2:]
As bad as I
Want you right here
I empathize with the way that you feel
Took away the thing
That you call your cute
If you could find the feeling you have from the start
You know we should never be apart
I'm asking you can you please listen to me

When you took me back before
I promise that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you
But what did I go do
And everytime I had the chance
To get into another nigga woman's pants
I would follow through
Without thinking of me and you

[2x Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me

[Bridge:]
When they want you
Come over and talk to me
I know I don't deserve to be a part
Of anyone tryna give me the heart
They loving me
Baby please
Come on over and talk to me
I see you like you've never seen him before
'cause you're the only one to show me the love

[Repeat Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me
