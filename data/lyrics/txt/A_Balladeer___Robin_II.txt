Well, it's been a few days now, so how have you been
Not that I should know what state you're in

I could care less

Well, I just bawled my eyes out and feel really relieved
Not that I threw up enough to fully retrieve

I'm still a mess

But what really helps a lot is the knowledge
That it's nothing but the time it takes
You gave me meals for thought
And Robin a laughing break
How quickly will he re-enter the lists?
Don't correct me if I'm wrong
I'm sure that grudge exists (especially his…)
And that mine will make a brilliant song

Well, lately I have not been that close with time
The weekends seem the worst ever since they're all mine

It's hard to get through

Well, congratulations - you entered the Torture Top 3
And by the way already not happy anniversary

Here's to you and your cool
Here's to me and my catch-22

But what really helps a lot is the knowledge
That it's nothing but the time it takes
It is funny - not at all half as funny as
To call me Robin by mistake
Don't correct me if I'm wrong
I'm sure that grudge exists (especially his…)
And that mine will make a brilliant song

A brilliant song
