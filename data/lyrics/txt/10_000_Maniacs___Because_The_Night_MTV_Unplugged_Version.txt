[Verse 1]
Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, and try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

[Verse 2]
Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring, a telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

[Bridge]
With love we sleep, with doubt the vicious cycle turns, and burns
Without you oh I cannot live, forgive the yearning Burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So take me now, take me now, take me now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
And everybody says that it belongs to us
