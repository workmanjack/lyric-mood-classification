These are the days

These are days you'll remember
Never before and never since, I promise, will the whole world be warm as this
And as you feel it, you'll know it's true that you are blessed and lucky
It's true that you are touched by something that will grow and bloom in you

These are days you'll remember
When May is rushing over you with desire to be part of the miracles you see in
Every hour
You'll know it's true that you are blessed and lucky
It's true that you are touched by something that will grow and bloom in you

These are days

These are the days you might fill with laughter until you break
These days you might feel a shaft of light make its way across your face
And when you do you'll know how it was meant to be
See the signs and know their meaning
It's true, you'll know how it was meant to be
Hear the signs and know they're speaking to you, to you
