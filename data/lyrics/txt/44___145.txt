Love
This is getting harder
And I can't seem to pick you out of the crowd
But you my dear
Have been discovered a liar
And I'm afraid that this is building up for far too long

And this is not the time or place for us speak like this
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water

In a different time or place the words can make more sense
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water

Even though it's the last time

Love
This is getting the best of me
And truth be told, you were the start of it all
Now you my dear, might end up lonely
Before you go, there's something you should know

And this is not the time or place for us to speak like this
And if I ever had the thought I'd never dream of it
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water

In a different time or place the words can make more sense
In a perfect world, the future wouldn't make it then
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water

Even though it's the last time

This is not the time or place for us to speak like this
And if I ever had the thought I'd never dream of it
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water

In a different time or place the words can make more sense
In a perfect world, the future wouldn't make it then
So dry your hollow eyes and lets go down to the water

Please, let's not speak, don't breathe a word
Even though it's the last time

Please, let's not speak, don't breathe a word
Even though it's the last time
