Again your world is crashing
In just the usual fashion
You look for my compassion
But I won't lend that to you anymore
And I'm out of forgiveness
Why should I waste my pity on you
Don't need a fallout now
Still you try to pretend
That you're always the victim
Wake up to see your friends are gone
But think that you've done nothing wrong The same conclusions have been drawn You brought this whole mess on yourself again
Now deal with the fallout
Why should I waste my pity on you
Don't need a fallout now
Still you try to pretend
That you're always the victim
Why should I waste my pity on you
Don't need a fallout now
Still you try to pretend
That you're always the victim
And now it's all fucked up again
It makes no difference in the end
Its out of my head
Its out of mind
Why should I waste my pity on you
Don't need a fallout now
Still you try to pretend
That you're always the victim
