[Verse 1]
I don't care where I go
When I'm with you
When I cry, you don't laugh
Because you know me

[Chorus]
I'm in you, you're in me
I'm in you, you're in me
Because you gave me the love
Love that I never had
Yes, you gave me the love
Love that I never had

[Verse 2]
You and I don't pretend
We make love
I can't feel any more
Than I'm singing, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Come so far when you think
Of last fall
You can't buy what we made
You and I, oh

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You gave me the love
Love that I never had
I don't care where I go
When I'm with you
