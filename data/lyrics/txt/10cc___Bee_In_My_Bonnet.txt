I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder
I got a hole in my shoe
And my toes are getting colder
I got ants in my pants
I got fries in my thighs
I got a bone in my nose
I got frit in my ass

I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder

I got a flee in my ear
I wear my heart on my sleeve
I got a ticket for the train
And I'm ready to leave
I got a rockin' pneumonia
And the boogie woogie flu
I got the palpations
All because of you

I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder

I'm burning, with love

I got my fish on the line
I got my hand in the water
I know right from wrong
So I do what I oughta

I laugh in the day
I cry in the night
Woo hoo baby
Gonna be alright

I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder
I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder
