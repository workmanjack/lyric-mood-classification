Love
This is getting harder
And I can't seem to pick you out of the crowd
But you my dear
Have been discovered a liar
And I'm afraid that this is building up for far too long

[Chorus]
And this is not the time or place for us to speak like this
Even if I had the thought I'd never dream of it
So dry your hollow eyes and let's go down to the water
In a different time or place the words could make more sense
In a perfect world the future wouldn't make a dent
So dry your hollow eyes and let's go down to the water

Even though it's the last time

Love
This is getting the best of me
And truth be told, you were the start of it all
Now you my dear might end up lonely (lonely)
Before you go there's something you should know (You should know)

[Chorus]
And this is not the time or place for us to speak like this
Even if I had the thought I'd never dream of it
So dry your hollow eyes and let's go down to the water
In a different time or place the words could make more sense
In a perfect world the future wouldn't make a dent
So dry your hollow eyes and let's go down to the water

Even though it's the last time

[Chorus]
And this is not the time or place for us to speak like this
Even if I had the thought I'd never dream of it
So dry your hollow eyes and let's go down to the water
In a different time or place the words could make more sense
In a perfect world the future wouldn't make a dent
So dry your hollow eyes and let's go down to the water

Please, let's not speak, don't breathe a word
Even though it's the last time

Please, let's not speak, don't breathe a word
Even though it's the last time
