How small do you want me to be
Wait in the balance, left lonely
So much can be said through silence
As hard as it seems
All that we need is to close to be seen

Our lives
You build your walls for me to climb
A billion walls for me to climb
You build your walls for me to climb

Travels the very nature we live in
Seasons to cycles children to men
Mislead, misread
Company or companion
With all of our hearts, we follow our dreams
Slightly out of reach

Our lives
You build your walls for me to climb
A billion walls for me to climb
You build your walls for me to climb
