That was your mom who I just informed
Now go back to bed while it’s still warm
Not one thing you need that is not in this lair
Lay down your arms - you're under my care

Close those eyes
Goodnight-night to you
Go and doze off
This cold winter through

And see what time will do

Let's pull up a chair now Janosch is here
For Ich mach dich gesund, sagte der Bär
And when you're fast asleep I will play with your hair
Through my tears I will breathe you're under my care

Close those eyes
Goodnight-night to you
Go and doze off
This cold winter through

The curtain's drawn
The sun long gone

Close those eyes
Goodnight-night to you
No, I won't take
A straight no from you

And when spring arrives we will have to see
If you're sick of life or - maybe - me
