I got me a job on the local paper
Everybody there thinks I'm nice
But they'd better look twice
'Cos it isn't me
I wanna be
Headline hustler
Scandal maker
Headline hustler
Money taker
You keep writing me letters
But I haven't got time
I'm busy looking at photographs
But they'd better not be from the bbc
You're gonna hear from me
Headline hustler
Scandal maker

Money taker
Better not turn around
I'll stab you in the back
And you don't know what I'm hiding
Under my plastic mac, under my plastic mac
I got a very good friend in the cia
And he says that he never takes bribes
But he's telling lies
'Cos he's into me
He knows I wanna be

If your brother's wearing dresses
And your neighbour's swapped his wife
Well, I'm gonna make the headlines
With your private life
With your other wife
