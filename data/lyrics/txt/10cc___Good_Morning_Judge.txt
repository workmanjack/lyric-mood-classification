Well, good morning Judge
How are you today?
I'm in trouble, please put me away
A pretty thing took a shine to me
I couldn't stop her so I let it be

I couldn't stop her so I let it be
I couldn't stop her so I let it be
I couldn't stop her so I let it be

He didn't do it
He wasn't there
He didn't want it
He wouldn't dare

Well, good morning judge
Yes I'm back again
I'm in trouble so it's back to the pen
I found a car but I couldn't pay
I fell in love and I drove it away

I fell in love and I drove it away
I fell in love and I drove it away
I fell in love and I drove it away

He didn't do it
He wasn't there
He didn't want it
He wouldn't dare

I didn't do it
I wasn't there
I didn't want it
I wouldn't dare

Alcatraz is like a home sweet home
I'm so wanted and I'm never alone
San Quentin is the place to be
I'm so happy and I don't wanna be free

So happy I don't wanna be free
So happy I don't wanna be free
So happy I don't wanna be free
