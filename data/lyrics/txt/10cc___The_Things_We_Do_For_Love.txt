Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go

Then she says she wants to make up
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall

The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love....
