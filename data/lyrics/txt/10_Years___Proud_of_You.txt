Shadows set mood
Innocence left the room
And all I know to do
Is shed a tear for you

Oh, oh, oh, oh...

Please don't be ashamed whether you win or lose
I just want you to know that I'm proud of you
Don't be afraid when your fight is through
I just need you to know that I'm here with you

I can't watch you choose
To pour salt in your wounds
Now all I know to do
Is say a prayer for you

Oh, oh, oh, oh...

Please don't be ashamed whether you win or lose
I just want you to know that I'm proud of you
Don't be afraid when your fight is through
I just need you to know that I'm here with you
