[Intro: Daron]
Why you gotta act like that?

[Verse 1: Daron]
When I say that I love you
You ask me what I want
When I try to care for you, whoa…
You say I’m trying to front
When I try to listen to you, oh baby…
You take it as a joke
And when I try to give you good advice, yeah…
You swear that I don’t know

[Chorus: Daron]
So what the hell do you want, uh, baby?
What the hell do you want from me?
What the hell do you want? I need to know
What the hell do you want, baby?
What the hell do you want from me
Baby, tell me, what the hell do you want from me yeah
Listen here, baby, I need to know right now, tell me how

[Verse 2: Mike]
When I try to make love to you, oh yeah, yeah, yeah…
You tell me not tonight
And when I wanna touch you, oh baby yeah…
You say that now is not the time
And when I wanna hold you, oh-ooh…
You tell me you need space
But you just said I wasn’t affectionate enough
That’s what you told me yesterday

[Chorus: Mike]
So what the hell do you want?
What the hell do you want from me yeah?
What the hell do you want? I don’t know what else to do yeah…
What the hell do you want from me baby? Yes!
What the hell do you want from me yeah… oh-ooh yeah…

[Outro: Mike]
Listen
You’re trying to deceive me
You’re trying to mislead me, yes… yes…
You didn’t appreciate what I was doing
So girl I’m just gon keep moving
You can’t hurt me no more yeah so I’m walking out that door
I said you can’t hurt me no more so I’m walking out that door
