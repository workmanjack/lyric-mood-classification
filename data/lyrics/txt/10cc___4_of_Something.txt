4% of something's
Better than 10% of nothing blue
Well I don't like the way you work
It's all I can do

Working on a number
My fingers to the bone on my guitar
Working on a number
My fingers to the bone on my piano
All I got the end of the day
Is a message from the King

4% of something's
Better than 10% of nothing blue
Well I don't like the way you work
It's all I can do

I'm trying to scratch a living
But, all this man is giving me is the blues
I'm trying to scratch a living
But, all the man is giving me is the blues
I've got to find a way to make my music play
Or I'm gonna lose my mind
