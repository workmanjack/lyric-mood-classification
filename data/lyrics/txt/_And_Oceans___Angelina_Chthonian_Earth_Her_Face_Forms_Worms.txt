Another day another night
It's all the same, but is it forever
Another way another time
Silence and happiness now together
Another end another life
It's all the same; it's all over
Another smile for parasites
And the dogs that can smell her

[Chorus:]
Can't you see the light? Can't you see the light?
No, no, no, no
Can't you see the light? Can't you see the light?
No, no, no, no
Can't you see the light? Can't you see the light?
No, no, no, no
Can't you see the light? Can't you see the light?
No, no, no, no

Another face another smile
Nails carving deeper and deeper
Another eye another sight
Seeing nothing never and ever
Another form another light
Crawling higher, higher and higher
Another skin another white
And a sun that is brighter

[Chorus:]
Another voice another sigh
Calling stronger and stronger
Another scent another life
Now smell the filth odour
Another taste another try
On your tongue the fruit so bitter
Another world another side
In control to crush your soul

[Chorus:]
Another face another form
It is her face that forms worms
