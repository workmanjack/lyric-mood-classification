I am the sum total of my ancestors
I carry their DNA
We are representatives of a long line of people
And we cart them around everywhere
This long line of people
That goes back to the beginning of time
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people
And we say: bring together the lines of me

When I look back over the years
At the things that brought tears to my eyes
Papa said we have to be wise
To live long lives
Now I recognize
What my father said before he dies
Vocalize things I've left unsaid
Left my spirit unfed for too long
I'm coming home to my family
Where I can be strong
Be who I planned to be
Within me my ancestry
Givin' me continuity
Would it be remiss to continue in this way
Would you rather I quit
Come with that other shit
Making people's hips sway
Lip service I pay, but I'm nervous
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep
Like a lifeline, I light lines
'Cause my compassion is deep
For the people who fashioned me, my soul to keep
And this is who I happen to be
And if I don't see that I'm strong, then I won't be
This is what my Daddy told me
I wished he would hold me
A little more
Than he did
But he taught me my culture
And how to live positive
I never want to shame
The blood in my veins and bring pain
To my sweet grandfather's face
In his resting place
I made haste to learn and not waste
Everything my forefathers earned in tears
For my culture
Fall back again
Crawl from the warm water
(For my culture)
Water to air
You're on your feet again
Your feet again
Hello Dad
Remember me?
I'm the man you thought I'd never be
I'm the boy who you
Reduced to tears
Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years
Yeah, that's right
My name Rob
I'm the one
Who landed the popstar's job
I'm the one who
You told look, don't touch
I'm the kid
Who wouldn't amount too much
I believe in the senses that I sound
I have always been too loud
Won't you help me drown it out?
And When I feel
What I'm feeling is so real
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel
Always digging in my heels
Now I got the faith to
Fall back again
Crawl from the warm water
Water to air
You're on your feet again
Your feet again
Ha, lace up your booty
Going back to the roots, continue my interlude
Feed freakin' for loot
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now
And your forefathers further know how
But now, what happened to the world without the hatred
Use your head, if the needle is wise, be the thread
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by best
Spreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth
This is what my Daddy told me
I wished he would hold me
A little more
Than he did
But he told me my culture
And how to live positive
I never want to shame
The blood in my veins and bring pain
To my sweet grandfather's face
In his resting place
I make haste to learn and not waste
Everything my forefathers earned in tears
For my culture
Fall back again
Crawl from the warm water
Water to air
You're on your feet again
Your feet again
(For my culture)
Fall back again
Crawl from the warm water
Water to air
Your on your feet again
Your feet again
(For my culture)
