( violin: Mary Ramsey )

That summer fields grew high with foxglove stalks and ivy
Wild apple blossoms everywhere
Emerald green like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me
There was no girl as warm as you

How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need
You'll never, you'll never know

The summer fields grow high
We made garland crowns in hiding, pulled stems of flowers from my hair
Blue in the stream like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me
There was no girl as bold as you

How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need
You'll never, you'll never know
You'll never know

Violet serene like none I have seen apart from dreams that escape me
There was no girl as warm as you

How I've learned to please, to doubt myself in need
You'll never, you'll never know
You'll never know

That summer fields grow high
We had wildflower fever
We had to lay down where they grow

How I've learned to hide, how I've locked inside, you'd be surprised if shown
But you'll never, you'll never know
