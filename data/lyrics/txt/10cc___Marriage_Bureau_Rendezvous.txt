Well I've been lookin' after number one for too long
And it seemed the love was passing me by
So I thought I better do something about it
And that's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you
That's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you
Well a lonely man needs a Marriage Bureau
Where they sit you right down and you fill in a form
Would you like a blonde or a black or a blue rinse
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall
Oh no, too many questions
I'm looking for a girl like Momma used to be
She's cooking up a dream, she's baking ecstasy
Won't it be fine when
I find her
Would I like to take her to a movie or the theatre
Would I pick her up at home or would I like to meet her
Somewhere we could take a good look at each other
Smile and say hello or walk away
Smile and say hello or walk away
So I'm squeaky clean in and out of the bath
I never shaved so close before
I'm gonna put on a tie, I'm gonna shine up my shoes
I'm gonna slick back my hair, I've got nothin' to lose
Oh, oh, I'll be stinkin' so good
Like I'm drowning in a sea of cologne
Hey... Do you know you remind me of someone
But I'm here making eyes at you
And I think we're gonna say goodbye to the bureau
