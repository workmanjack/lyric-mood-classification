I love this world
And these people, the beautiful ones
I love this world
And your goddamn sun

I love this world
And the family of fragile dreams
I love this world
When the world goes to sleep

[Chorus:]
You're so pretty - planet dead
You're so pretty - planet dead
You're so pretty - planet dead
You're so pretty - planet dead

I love this world
Empty with it's black holes
I love this world
And the ones without a soul

I love this world
With a bullet for each one
I love this world
When tomorrow never comes

[Chorus]
