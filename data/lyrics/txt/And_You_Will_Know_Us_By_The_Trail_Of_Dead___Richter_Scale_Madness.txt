[Intro]
Okay this is a song about killing everybody, let's all sing along now

[Verse 1]
Dream machine
John and Exene
Smear campaign
And a swat team

[Verse 2]
Let's have a feudal lord
Let's have a fascist regime
Side effects
Coupled with withdrawl bleeding

[Verse 3]
This is a riot, right?
Let's all riot riot
Let's tear this place to shit
Commit pact suicide

[Break]
Come on ... [?]
1995, ... [?] we're all gonna die
.. [?]
You know you all want it, now let's all kill ourselves

Kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill

[Verse 3]
Put your hand to my mouth
And a gun to my head
Let's stop this false pretence
Become real friends

[Verse 4]
Let's have a mustard gas war
Because a fuck's a fuck
Richter scale madness
Join the gun club, join the gun club
Join the gun club, join the gun club
