Oo he's a sly one
He's a razamataz man
He flew in from Singapore
On a flying junk man
Oo he's a devil
Oo and the devil's gonna bring you down
Oo he's a stalwart
With a heavy load on
He's got a finger in everyone's pie
And he's got what you want
Oo he's a salesman
Oo and his goods are gonna bring you down
He's never got the stuff
If you ever come to him without money
He hasn't got the time
For the people who are down on their knees
But if the price is right
You won't be asking him where it came from
Oo he's a remnant
From the swingin' sixties
He pushed his load down the Kings Road
To the Chelsea Potter
Oo he's a snow job
Oo and his shovels gonna cover you
