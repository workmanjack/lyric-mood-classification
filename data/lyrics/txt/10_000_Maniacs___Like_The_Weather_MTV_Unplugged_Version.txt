[Verse 1:]
The color of the sky as far as i can see is coal gray
Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my lips as if i might cry
Well by the force of will my lungs are filled and so i breathe
Lately it seems this big bed is where i never leave
Shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
Quiver in my voice as i cry

[Chorus:]
What a cold and rainy day
Where on earth is the sun hid away?

[Verse 2:]
I hear the sound of a noon bell chime, i'm far behind
You've put in 'bout half a day while here i lie
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my lip as if i might cry

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Do i need someone
Here to scold me or do i need someone
Who'll grab and pull me
Out of this four poster dull torpor
Pulling downward
It is such a long time since my better days
I say my prayers nightly this will pass away
The color of the sky is gray as i can see through the blinds
Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my voice as i cry

[Chorus:]
What a cold and rainy day
Where on earth is the sun hid away?
I shiver, quiver, and try to wake
