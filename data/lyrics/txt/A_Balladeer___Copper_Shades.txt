The copper shades you wore
Were very big and green
And I was only feather-light
Above the engine-roar
In the smell of gasoline
You'd make sure I'd hold on tight

And there we'd go with no direction
Anywhere the wind would blow
And I would ask you all these questions
While your pride of me would show

Then in an act of love
You'd pull me close and check
My orange-colored water wings
You'd turn the engine off
And somewhere from the back
We'd both jump in for a swim

And there we'd go with no direction
Anywhere the wind would blow
And I would ask you all these questions
While your pride of me would show

And safe in your Calypso
With the world of wise Cousteau below
And ice cream castles overhead
Now how was I to know
How was I to know

A towel round my chest
Your copper shades back on
We would speed up fast
And dry up by the sun
