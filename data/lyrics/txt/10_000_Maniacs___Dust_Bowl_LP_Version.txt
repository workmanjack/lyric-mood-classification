[Verse 1:]
I should know to leave them home
They follow me through the store
With these toys i can't afford
"kids, take them back
You know better than that"
Dolls that talk, astronauts, t.V. Games, airplanes
They don't understand
And how can i explain?

[Chorus:]
I try and try but i can't save
Pennies, nickels, dollars slip away
I've tried and tried but i can't save

[Verse 2:]
My youngest girl has bad fever, sure
All night with alcohol
To cool and rub her down
Ruby, i'm tired
Try and get some sleep
I'm adding doctor's fees to remedies
With the cost of
Three day's work lost

[Chorus 1:]
I try and try but i can't save
Pennies, nickels, dollars slip away
I've tried and tried but i can't save
The hole in my pocketbook is growing

[Chorus 2:]
There's a new wind blowing they say
It's gonna be a cold, cold one
So brace yourselves my darlings
It won't bring anything much our way
But more dust bowl days

[Verse 3:]
I played a card
In this week's game
Took the first and the last letters
In three of their names
This lottery's been building up for weeks
I could be lucky me
With the five million prize
Tears of disbelief spilling out of my eyes

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
