Oh I know your kind
You would kill your kin for the right price
Oil and water are thicker than blood
Oh I know your type

Use us to get what you wanted
You can't finish what you started
Find it kind of funny how you try
To rectify the damage

Your failure to find compromise
The walls are coming down
Will you survive sacrifice
Or tumble to the ground?

Your lying to yourself
And to everyone that knows your name
You play the part of the fool so well
Oh I know your type

Use us to get what you wanted
You can't even finish what you started
Find it kind of funny how you try
To rectify the damage

Your failure to find compromise
The walls are coming down
Will you survive sacrifice
Or tumble to the ground?

Oh I know your type

Your failure to find compromise
The walls are coming down
Will you survive sacrifice
Or tumble to the ground?
