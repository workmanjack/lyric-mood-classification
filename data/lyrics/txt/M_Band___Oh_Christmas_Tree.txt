Oh Christmas tree, oh christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely
Oh Christmas tree, oh christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely
Each year you bring to me delight, meaning in the christmas night
Oh Christmas tree, oh christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely

Oh Christmas tree, oh christmas tree, with faithful leaves unchanging
Oh Christmas tree, oh christmas tree, with faithful leaves unchanging
Your boughs are green, in sommers glow and do not fade in winters snow
Oh Christmas tree, oh christmas tree, with faithful leaves unchanging

Each year you bring to me delight, meaning in the christmas night
Oh Christmas tree, oh christmas tree, of all the trees most lovely
