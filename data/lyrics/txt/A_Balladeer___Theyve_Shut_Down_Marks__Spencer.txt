They've shut down Marks & Spencer
The windows all are blind
No more English breakfasts
But no one seems to mind

After Christmas sales have started
The trees are out there on the streets
Another year of resolutions
And I still drag my feet

The memory is out here
The memory is here
The memory's been out here
For more than a year

They've shut down Marks & Spencer
The windows all are blind
Last year it reached the papers
But then I didn't mind

The memory is out here
The memory is here
The memory's been out here
For more than a year

I'm not out here in the rain
So it isn't all that bad
It's this thing I have with change
That I have never had

They've shut down Marks & Spencer
The windows all are blind
