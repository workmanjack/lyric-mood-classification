Kitty Kitty, kitty kitty cat
Kitty Kitty, kitty kitty cat
Well my kitty cat ran I was so sad inside
The feelings that I have I can no longer hide
I want him back as fast as I can
He's my little buddy and I'm his friend
Without my little kitty I don't know what to do
I'm felling sad and blue
He has a little red nose and a fuzzy head
A soft couch to sleep on, he's quite well fed
Instead I will brush and pet him all the time
I think he really likes it cause he gives the sign
A little nudge of his nose and a sandpaper lick
Sticks his claws in my back and I scream aww shit
But he doesn't mean to hurt I ‘m gonna be real kind
Without my little kitty think I'm loosin my mind
I'm bribin other cats to search for Max
I Said, I'm bribin other cats to search for Max
I'm offerin things that they can't refuse
Like Purina cat chow and some soft beef chews
A little mousy and a ball of catnip
A bowl of cream and some tuna-fish dip
I think its kind of working cus they're searching around
Max is a homie and he must be found
I leave the windows open, I hope that he'll jump in
I've gotta see him soon, he's such a cute little thing
So if you're out there Max and you hear this song
Hey, little buddy, will ya please come home?
I called my man Bret to explain my situation
He said grab a pen and paper, start a new creation
Radio stations all across the nation will be down no doubt with your unique situation
I remember the days when I would go to bed
Wake up in the morning with Max on my head, my face so full of hair I'd want ta scream and holler
Unable because my mouth's full of flea collar
But, that's the fact, he's gone and I'm blue
I wrote this little song, think it's the right thing to do
So, little girl if you can find my kitty
Will you please bring him back to my part of the city
If you bring him back soon you get a sweet surprise
I'll kiss you right on the mouth and take a swim in your eyes
I think it's a fair fee so I hope you're down
My address is (something...) P. O. Box a thousand clowns
