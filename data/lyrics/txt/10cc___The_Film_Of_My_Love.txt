Co-starring you
And co-starring me
Starring us both together
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Forever and ever and ever
A back lot romance
A scripted affair
The screenplay a blessing from heaven
We're gone with the wind
On the Orient Express
To join the Magnificent Seven
The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over
A close-up of yours
A long shot of mine
Superimposed together
I'll zoom in on you
With a love that is true
In cinemascope forever
A clapper board kiss
There's an Oscar in this
A hit or a miss whatever
A box office wedding
A premier for two
We'll be on location forever
When Pathe recall
The thrill of it all
They'll edit us both together
A legend a classic
An epic of love
Captured on film forever
A lasting embrace
That time can't erase
Let them censor the wind
Or the weather
The film of my love
Will conquer the world
Forever and ever and ever
The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over
Over and over and over
