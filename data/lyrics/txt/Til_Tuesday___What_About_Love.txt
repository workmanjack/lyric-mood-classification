Living on silence
Living by the book
You get it to a science
Of living on one good look
So put out all the fires
And blow away the smoke
I'm getting pretty tired
Of living on hope

So what about love, baby
What about making room for two
What about love, baby
What about you

Living on daydreams
Walking in my sleep
And nothing is as it seems
When you're in so deep
So put out all the fires
And blow away the smoke
Unless you're getting tired
Of living on hope

So what about love, baby
What about making room for two
What about love, baby
What about you

So what about love, baby
What about making room for two
What about love, baby
What about you

What about you
What about you
What about me
