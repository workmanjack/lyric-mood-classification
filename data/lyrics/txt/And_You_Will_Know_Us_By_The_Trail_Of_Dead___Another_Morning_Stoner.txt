Are you asleep, are you in a dream?
The copper shades of a morning
Distant lights beckon and fade
Unwritten songs of another day

I fear that you would never be
Every song in the world for me
I took your hand, led you astray
You cursed the worlds I longed to save
To save
To save

Is heaven to you a perfect place?
The look of sorrow on a sufferer's face?
A field of lives to sow and reap
That some of us will never see

Why is it I don't feel the same?
Are my longings to be blamed
For not seeing heaven like you would see
Why is a song a world for me?
For me
For me

What is forgiveness?
It's just a dream
What is forgiveness?
It's everything
What is forgiveness?
It's just a dream
What is forgiveness?
It's everything
What is forgiveness?
It's just a dream
What is forgiveness?
It's everything
What is forgiveness?
It's just a dream
What is forgiveness?
It's everything
