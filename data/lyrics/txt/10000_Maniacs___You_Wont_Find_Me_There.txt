I'd like to know what makes you stay while your eyes still search for escape
You think that I don't feel the cold, but I wait while confessions unfold
You'll never make a living from reading minds
Or from getting your direction from exit signs
Look into your heart and you won't find me there
You won't find me where you hide and that makes us a matter of time
Like trees exposed by fall, time reveals it all
Tell me you want to do everything but you're stuck up to your knees
And I'm less likely pushed forward by ambition than a breeze
But there's a flame that must be fanned, and it appears as a beckoning hand
Don't think 'cause you're not talking you're being kind
You've been getting your direction from exit signs
Look into your heart and you won't find me there
