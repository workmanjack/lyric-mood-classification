[Verse 1]
I'm a clockwork creep
And I can't get to sleep
They wind me up and let me go
And I can't unwind
Going out of my mind
My time is coming soon you know

[Refrain]
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb

[Verse 2]
I'm a jumbo jet
With a brand new set
Of passengers and bags and crew
I'll spread my wings -
Do a thousand things
To prove how good I am to you

[Refrain]
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb

[Verse 3]
Meanwhile in the cargo of escargot
The temperature is rising
Advertising that our time is running down
Down, down, down, down
Oh with just one minute to live
Oh, no you'll never get me up in one of these again
'Cos what goes up (What goes up)
Must come
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Oh, the gravity of the situation
It's only my willpower
That keeps this thing in operation
But we're gonna crash that's for certain
The pilot is too busy flirtin'
And he ain't aware
That there's a bomb down there
And if he don't do something it's curtains

[Verse 4]
Now just hold on
Said the little bomb
If you were just to hold my hands
Then time would stop
The plot would flop
And jumbo would be safe to land

[Refrain]
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb

[Verse 5]
My landings are the envy
Of Sabena and Pan Am
Chattanooga to Japan
I taxi through the airways -
What a safe little plane
What a fine little plane
What a great little plane I am

[Verse 6]
Hang on one sec
I'm a clockwork wreck
And though my fuse is burning slow
Must keep my date to detonate
Goodbye, ta ta, and cheerio

[Refrain]
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a-
