City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there’s
A feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you’ll hear:
Silver bells, silver bells
It’s Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
City street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa’s big scene
And above all this bustle you’ll hear:
Silver bells, silver bells
It’s Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
