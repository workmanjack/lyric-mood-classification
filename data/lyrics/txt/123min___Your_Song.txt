Whenever we're alone
I get beside myself
Can't wait 'til you get home
It's you and no one else

When I look into your eyes I see
This is more than just a dream
And everyday it grows
And I know
To be this is what's meant
The way I feel for you
There's no need to pretend

Just sorry it took so long
Well baby, here's your song

I live for your laughter
Your happiness is all I'm after

Every time you go away
You take a little piece of me with you

I long to see the sunlight on your face
And you know
You're the only thing in my life I can't replace
When it feels this right it can't be wrong

Just sorry it took so long
Well baby, here's your song

It might be hard for you to sing along
Well baby, heres your song
