Looking back in time
Through verses set in nursery rhyme
At oil painted eyes
Of muses left behind
I swear I know not why
Those eyes have always left me dry

She stands with arms stretched out
Towards the mountains and the clouds
Oil painted eyes
Blind yet hypnotized
I swear I know not why
Those eyes have always left me dry
Me dry

How near, how far, how lost they are
How near, how far, how lost they are
How near, how far, how lost they are
How near, how far, how lost they are
How near, how far, how lost they are
How near, how far

I've rendered every line
Every contour of a muse's eye
Painted in my eyes mind
On canvases of time
I swear I know not why
Those eyes have always left me dry
Me dry
Me dry
