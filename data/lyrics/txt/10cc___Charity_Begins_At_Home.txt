A shake of the tin
The money drops in, but is it a sin
You're standing in rags
You're selling your flags
But who gets the dough at the end of the day
We saw your drop-dead fancy wheels
Your little house up on the hill
But when your conscience pricks
A little sacrifice sweetens the pill
So keep your hands in your pockets
Charity begins at home
Keep your hands in your pockets
Charity won't leave you alone
We take to the stage
The audience rave, we're doing our bit
A heavenly cast, a blast from the past
There's a song to be sung, will it make number one
We wanna see your money roll
But our eyes are on the hall of fame
'cos business is business
And hits are the name of the game
So keep your hands in your pockets
Charity begins at home
Keep your hands in your pockets
Charity won't leave you alone
Everywhere that we turn
There are mouths to be fed
How can we sleep
The battle goes on while we're
Safe in our beds
So don't turn away
No don't turn away
Your doors are locked
You switch on the box to take in a show
You think that you're safe
But here comes that face
And wouldn't you know it's that message again
They want to take your plastic cash
Your hand reaches out to the phone
Keep your hands in your pockets
Charity begins at home
Keep your hands in your pockets
Charity begins at home
Keep your hands in your pockets
Charity won't leave you alone
Everywhere that we turn
There are mouths to be fed
How can we sleep
The battle goes on while we're
Safe in our beds
So don't turn away
No don't turn away
Keep your hands in your pockets
Charity begins at home
Keep your hands in your pockets
Charity won't leave you alone
