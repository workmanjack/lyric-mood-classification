Hello there
How have you been
I've called a million times
But to me you're never in
I know I never had the style
Or dash of Errol Flynn
But I loved you
I'm doing really well
I'm as happy as a lark
I got a new apartment
It's as safe as Central Park
And if they ever mug me
When I'm walking in the dark
Will you know
Don't hang up
Don't hang up
Rolled up in my camera
With the big cheese up above
I stumbled from my stag night
To a never ending limousine
The band went la di da di da
And I got loady do di dodied
Lousy violins began to play
I went no no no
And as the vol-au-vents exploded
I was walking down the aisle the other way
Don't hang up
Don't hang up
Don't say, Oooh
Nobody's safe in our house
Leave me alone
But a but a please
Leave me alone
Just a mo, a minute
I'm so alone
We had
Some honeymoon on itchy bedding
Scum buzzing round your busy body
Dumb waiters waiting sweating straining
All mass-debating my woman
We got a
Bum Guatemala pensione
Crumbling about our ears, Ole
Even the trash man he say
You got a dustbin romance
It's going down the drain
You got a low impedence
She's got a rocky terrain
Oo, you got a lot to learn
Oo, you got a lot to learn
You got a lot to learn about women
A lot to learn about women women
What's to learn about women
We've both got a lot to learn
Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes
Have we won the no Nobel Prize
Has the colour run out of our dies
Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes
When the barman said "What're you drinking?"
I said marriage on the rocks
I know I never had the style
Or dash of Errol Flynn
But I loved you
Don't hang up
Don't hang up
Don't say......
