She walks alone on the brick lane
A year had changed her forever
The breeze is blowing
He used to live so close here
Just like her grey home
We'd look for places I can't remember
The world was safe when she knew him
She tried to hold him, hold on forever
For all that never happens and all that never will be
The earth was raw in her fingers
A candle burning for the love we seldom keep
She overturned it
Considered planting some flowers
No one to tend them
They wouldn't last long
It's funny how these things go
The memories made her weary
You were the answer to all the questions
She shuddered slowly
She didn't want to
As a distant summer he began to whisper
She looked into the glass
And threw a smile her way
Together present past
Liquid surface showing that they were melding
So where can I go from here?
He didn't answer
The color fading
So close forever
She tried to hold him, hold on forever
She felt him slip from her vision
In a silent frozen sleep
