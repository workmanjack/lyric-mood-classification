[Verse 1]
In the middle of a caravan
On a four-wheel drive oasis
There's a man with a thought in mind
To cash in on the desert faces
He's got a truckload of Yorkshire girls
For the harem going places
And the border bums never saw
The guns in the whiskey cases

[Chorus]
There's a real big demand
And it's written in the palm of his hand
He's gonna change the face of the desert
He's gonna sweep away the sand

[Verse 2]
Hang on sheik, I've got a yellow streak
I ain't here, I'm a mirage
Get back Des, keep it under your fez
And don't give us away in the massage
Look what I did for the pyramid
I put a pool in and made it pay
I built an elevator and a film theater
And shipped it to the U.S.A

[Chorus]
Cause there's a real big demand
And it's written in the palm of my hand
I'm gonna change the face of the desert
I'm gonna sweep away the sand

[Verse 3]
Hang on friends!
There's a lot more goodies in the pipeline
So this ain't the time to close the deal
Here's the deal
Ooh, now you've got a Howitzer all of your own
Ooh, and a Panzer division to chauffeur you home
Gun-running is fun
But hang on, friends
Hang on friends

[Verse 4]
Allah be praised, there's a whole new craze
We're gonna shoot up the Foreign Legion
And it's up with the Sheikh
And down with the Frog
We're gonna liberate the region
Oh Effendi, we're gonna bury your head in the sand
Oh Effendi, you better get off my doggone land
Hey, Prince of the Moonbeams
Son of the Sun
Light of a thousand stars
Your guerillas are urban
And there's bourbon on your turban
And the sun shines out of your ass
Oh Effendi, I'm gonna grovel in your wake
Oh Effendi, it's all been a big mistake

[Outro]
You're gonna cut out my liver
If I don't deliver
Things are getting out of hand
I'm going to ride off into the sunset
I'll make a deal with the promised land
Goodbye friends
There's no more goodies in the pipeline
