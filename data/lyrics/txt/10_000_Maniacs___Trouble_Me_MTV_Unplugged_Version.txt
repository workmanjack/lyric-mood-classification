Trouble me, disturb me with all your cares and your worries
Trouble me on the days when you feel spent
Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden when my back is sturdy and strong?
Trouble me

Speak to me, don't mislead me, the calm I feel means a storm is swelling;
There's no telling where it starts or how it ends
Speak to me, why are you building this thick brick wall to defend me when your silence is my greatest fear?
Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden when my back is sturdy and strong?
Speak to me

Let me have a look inside these eyes while I'm learning
Please don't hide them just because of tears
Let me send you off to sleep with a "There, there, now stop your turning and tossing."
Let me know where the hurt is and how to heal

Spare me? Don't spare me anything troubling
Trouble me, disturb me with all your cares and your worries
Speak to me and let our words build a shelter from the storm
Lastly, let me know what I can mend
There's more, honestly, than my sweet friend, you can see
Trust is what I'm offering if you trouble me
