I would walk, I would walk, I would walk
A thousand miles, if I knew that you
Would be waiting on the other side
I would climb, I would climb, I would climb
The highest mountain
If you would fulfil the promise to be mine oh mine
I would swim, the seven seas
If we could sit down and talk about us
And agree to agree
I would walk without water
Across the death of sand
To here you say you're ready to be in love again
People are talking, trying to build us apart
They can't see the love in our hearts
Girl I care about you and you care about me
And if we believe in each other
We goin' be alright, yes we will
We goin' be alright, alright
We goin' be alright, yes we will
If we believe in each other
We goin' be alright, alright!
