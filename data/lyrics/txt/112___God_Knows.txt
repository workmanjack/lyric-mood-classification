[Verse 1: Daron]
Baby tell me why, why do you question
All this love that I have for you
If you look into my eyes you'll make an exception
I will show you love like no one before
Put your trust in me, allow me to be there
Baby give me your hand to hold
Cause the feelings that I have are so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows

[Chorus: 112]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew
What God knows…

[Verse 2: Q]
Baby tell me what, what is the reason
One good reason you're so insecure
Cause after all that I have done
I think you should know by now
Girl I'm down for you and the love I have is pure
I wanna help you understand just how I feel for you
You're the one that I can't let go
Because the feeling that I have is so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows

[Chorus: 112]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew
What God Knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew
What God Knows…

[Bridge: Slim & 112]
And all of my lonely days, only God knows how lonely
And oh the sleepless nights baby, only God sees me cry
And everytime I think of you, only God can read my mind
God knows I tried to help you understand
And Heaven knows I miss you
Only God can see how much
Cause everytime you go away, I long for your touch
And when I say I love you girl, only God sees my heart
He sees my heart, he sees my heart

[Chorus: Slim & 112]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew
What God knows  how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew
What God knows…
