Pay attention, pay attention, pay attention please
He who lusts through life for excess in this world
Dies a lonely man, careless of his soul
Throwing caution to the wind with foolish ignorance
You're full of pride
Full of pride
Full of pride
And in arrogance you can't accept the nearing end of this short lived life

Smile and give a toast, brag and boast
Fool the world with all of your lies
The parasite's host never even knows
Pull the wool over our eyes

Walk the line and pay the price
A pound of flesh for paradise
Wear the wounds of your demise

Fail to mention your intentions, fail to mention why
The actions of your life contradict your words...
The path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse
Washing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence
Ignore the signs

Smile and give a toast, brag and boast
Fool the world with all of your lies
The parasite's host never even knows
Pull the wool over our eyes

Walk the line and pay the price
A pound of flesh for paradise
Wear the wounds of your demise
A pound of flesh for paradise

Bend the truth till you can't find it
Find it
Twist your lies till you don't mind them
Mind them

Walk the line and pay the price
A pound of flesh for paradise
Wear the wounds of your demise
Demise
From cradle to grave, you chose to trade
A pound of flesh for paradise
Wear the wounds of your demise
