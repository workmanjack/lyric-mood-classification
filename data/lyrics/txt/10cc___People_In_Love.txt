People in love do funny things
Walk under buses and burn their wings
People like us do nothing right
Talk to the ceiling into the night
Look at the smile in her eyes
I knew I was right in my bones
I feel the turnin' of wheels as it grows
Look at my face in her eyes
Am I right, am I wrong
She's given me butterflies all along

Ooh sitting alone in the dark
Ooh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell me it's time to go

People in love play silly games
Running in circles and everywhere
People like us can make believe
Love is forever and I'll never be

Ooh sitting alone in the dark
Ooh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell us it's time to go
