Across the fields 10.000 Maniacs

Well they left then in the morning
A hundred pairs of wings in the light moved together
In the colors of the morning
I looked to the clouds in the cirrus sky and they'd gone
Across the marshes, across the fields below
I fell through the vines and I hoped they would catch me below
If only to take me with them there
Tell me the part that shines in your heart on the wind
And the reeds blew me in the morning
Take me along to the places you've gone when my eyes looked away
Tell me the song that you sing in the trees in the dawning
Tell me the part that shines in your heart
And the rays of love forever, please take me there
