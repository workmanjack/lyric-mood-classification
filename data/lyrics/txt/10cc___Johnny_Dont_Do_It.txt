Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it

Johnny was an angel
An angel dressed in black
He used to hang around the guys
Down at the local track
He tried so hard to join them
But they always turned him back

Johnny don't do it
He was an angel
Johnny don't do it
Such an angel

He was only 17
Just got out of school
He stole a bike from Joe's garage
To prove that he was cool
He didn't know that the brakes were worn
And fate can be so cruel

Johnny don't do it
He was an angel
Johnny don't do it
Such an angel

Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it

Well Johnny went a riding
With his girlfriend on the back seat
Looking for some action
And they found it down a back street
Suddenly a truck pulled out
He tried to step on the brake

Johnny don't do it (Here is a news flash)
Johnny don't do it (Today, Johnny Kowalski, also known as Johnny Angel)
Johnny don't do it (and his young fiance Francine, were tragically killed)
Johnny don't do it (in a cycle accident)
Don't do it, don't do it (any witnesses please contact)
Don't do it, don't do it (the police at Precinct 29)

Now Johnny's with the angels
The angels in the sky
I wonder if he thinks of us
As he goes riding by
If only had listened
Oh the number of times we tried
To tell him

Johnny don't do it
He was an angel
Johnny don't do it
Such an angel
Johnny don't do it
He was an angel
Johnny don't do it
Such an angel
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
Johnny don't do it
