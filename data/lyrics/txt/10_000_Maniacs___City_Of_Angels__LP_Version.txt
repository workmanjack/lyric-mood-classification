[Verse 1:]
Heaven, is this heaven where we are?
See them walking, if you dare
If you call that walking
Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves
Along the streets of heaven
Where is the blessed table
To feed all who hunger on earth
Welcomed and seated each one joyfully served?
See them walking, if you dare
If you call that walking
Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves
Along the streets of heaven
Where is the halo
That should glow 'round your face
And where are the wings that
Should grow from your shoulder blades?

[Chorus:]
These sobering sights i've seen
In the city of angels
Have all been one rude awakening
That was due to me in heaven

[Verse 2:]
There would have been heavenly music
I was convinced before
And a host of the dearly to meet me
With hosannas sung at the door

[Chorus:]
But these sobering sights i've seen
In the city of angels
Have all been one rude awakening
That was due to me
In this city of fallen angels
