Inhale, exhale
Inhale the exhaled
Inhale, exhale
Inhale the injected voice
Inhale, exhale
Exhale the inhaled
Inhale, exhale
Inhale the lines of white noise

Silence depicted the room
And released the liquids in drops
Infinity licks the tongue of thorns
And devours the cities in drone

These designers of syndromes
The core of poison free sound
Slowly drifting to the mind of dub

Gardens swallow the idyllic life
Inhales heavens to earthly eyes
Open palms of autumn scars
Adieus to plaintive solar charm
