Skipping streets in springtime
Chasing sunlight on my bike
And I could chalk the sidewalk
Any color that I liked

Blowing dandelions
Fairground rides and climbing trees
And mother's kiss or candy
For every injured knee

There are no action heroes out there
To come and save the world from harm
Superman can't move his legs
And I can't use my arms

Superman can't move his legs

Grandma's cake and candles
Magic bean plants in a jar
Shared baths and bedtime stories
From Prickly Leg to Matthew Star

Sleeping Beauty's sleeping
I’m not the boy I used to be
Surrounded by the bad guys
The only fairy here is me

There are no action heroes out there
To come and save the world from harm
Superman can't move his legs
And I can't use my arms

Superman can't move his legs

I don't know much but
If I've learned something from the past
It's: girls go for assholes
And happy endings never last

There are no action heroes out there
To come and save the world from harm
Superman can't move his legs
And I can't use my arms

Superman can't move his legs
