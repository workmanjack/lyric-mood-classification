Sam here says he lost his call
On the day Cousteau had died
The ocean was a tub of sharks
With Jacques Yves as a guide

Sam here says the water's safe
That man should not have left the seas
Called the Human Bathyscaphe
He's King of Expertise

So if someone wants to know
And asks you where I am
You say you saw me go
For a swim with Sam

Sam here says they call him "nice"
And that it makes him really sick
That his "nice" is like "polite"
And silence does the trick

Sam here says he'd like to go
Somewhere far away from here
To a sea that no one knows
To completely disappear

So if someone wants to know
And asks you where I am
You say you saw me go
For a swim with Sam

Don't try to talk me out of this
Not while I'm here in Carla's seat
"The sea has many drops of water
But the salt won't let you taste the sweet"
(2x)

Don't try to talk me out of this
"Don't go, don't go, don't go ..."
Not while I'm here in Carla's seat
"Don't go, don't go, don't go ..."
