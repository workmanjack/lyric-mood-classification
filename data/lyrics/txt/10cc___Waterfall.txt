Gonna meet you on the corner
Gonna take you out of town
Out to where the grass is greener
And no one can be found

Gonna be there in the morning
Gonna take you by the hand
Gonna get out of the city
Gonna get back to the land

Waterfall, and it's fallin' down on me
Waterfall, and it's fallin' down
But it ain't gonna let me be

Gonna be there in the morning
Gonna take you by the hand
Gonna get out of the city
Gonna get back to the land

Waterfall, and it's fallin' down on me
Waterfall, and it's fallin' down
But it ain't gonna let me be

Hey, Waterfall
Hey, Waterfall
Hey, Waterfall
Hey, Waterfall
