My baby, she's crazy, she's lazy
So she's always bummin' around
Girls in France don't stand a chance
'Cos I've always got my baby around
So, don't touch her
Oh, it's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine
At night we, sleep tight we
Stay close together 'cos the temperature's down
But baby, says maybe
Each time I try to get my fingers around
Please don't touch her
Sittin' with a tentpole, what a bloody jamboree
Listen to our motto, be prepared for ecstasy
Here comes the bride
My baby, goes topless
And brings her beauty to a bottomless day
She's bathing, al fresco
And all her mystery is there on display
So, don't get too close
Oh she's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine
Ooh it's a drag when you're hitched to a dream
And the boys in the gang think she's part of the scenery
You're never alone and the tension is painful to see
One night I, crept in and
Got on my knees and tried to make her my wife
One reef knot, two grannies
And we were bound to stay together for life
Now we'd like to......
