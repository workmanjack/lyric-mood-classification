This is a dps production...

Give me a beat. [X8]

I'm gonna have some fun tonight
Lookin for a girl tonight
Lookin for a perfect per-son-ality
And she gotta have a freaky side

If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this

Baby all that you need and more
Shakin off all this drama in my life
Girl I'm kickin it at the door

Cause it's all about me and you

[Chorus X2]
The dambdest thing
I wanna buy you all the finest things
Big house in the hills
Supersize your rings
My mind's on my money
And my money's on my mind
Get you up out of the ghetto
I just want you to shine
So don't be telling your girls my money don't stretch
And don't be sayin that 112 don't make hits
Cause you know I moved up
From the 5 to the six
When I shift with the radio
I know they gonna like this
Sayin Def Jam is like sayin no stress man
Tv's and champaign in the stretch Lex man
Pour a glass for yourself and pass it to the next man
Takin trips from Atlanta to the Kamen Islands
Forget your problems, lay back, catch a tan
You know we livin it up, chillin in the sand
Catch me off in the club, spend a couple grand
It's Un-be-live-a-ble

[Chorus X4]
