You rave on about a car drive
Somewhere out in Germany
You had dinner near some river
Like you can't get that with me

And it all sounds so familiar
I make sure to bite my tongue
It's done nothing else but trouble
Kind of like our song

And all because

All I wanted was
The best of both of us

This must be what Robin felt like
Who'd have thought I'd fit his shoes
How I'd smirk inside your T-shirt
After he had called for you

I've been him in that hotel room
When I took it as a no
Now I'd rather be in Hamburg
Putting up our breakfast show

And all because

All I wanted was
The best of both of us
All I wanted was

For us to get across
For things to be like then, out there on the road
For my mediocre jokes to work again

We can leave tonight –
I'll drive us past the wood
Just sit there being beautiful
While I'll be good

Hell, I'll be good

All I wanted
All I wanted was

I'm telling myself it's all for the better
