Now that our ties are severed
As we wave goodbye
Let us not wonder whether
We are ready to take the dive

Let it dive, let it die, let it fade out of sight
Let it drag us down, let it fade

Grieve, but not grieve together
Mourn with nothing to say
Gone are those times forever
Lost are those sweet warm other days

Let it dive, let it die, let it fade out of sight
Let it drag us down, let it come between you and I
Let it dive, let it die, let it fade

Were we born to despair
Deeds done but not forgiven?
There will always be something there
As long as one of us goes on living

Let it dive, let it die
Let it fade out of sight
Let it drag us down, let it come between you and I
What is done is done, no reason to apologize
Let it dive, let it die, let it fade
