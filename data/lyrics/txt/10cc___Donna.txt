Oh Donna
You made me stand up
You made me sit down, Donna
Sit down, Donna
Sit down
You made stand up
Donna waiting by the telephone
Donna waiting for the phone to ring
Oh Donna
You make me break up
You make me break down, Donna
Break down, Donna
Break down
You make me break up
Meanwhile waiting by the telephone
Donna is waiting for the phone to ring
"Hello, darling
Yes I love you darling
Yes I love you"
Oh Donna
You made me stand up
You made me sit down, Donna
Sit down, Donna
Sit down
You make stand up
Donna I'd stand on my head for you
Oh my love, my own one
Oh my love, my own one
Donna waiting by the telephone
Donna waiting for the phone to ring
Oh Donna
Oh Donna
Oh Donna
Oh Donna
Donna I love you
