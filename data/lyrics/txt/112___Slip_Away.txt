Baby...
I wish you had recognized...
The love I had for you...
When it was in my heart...
And when it was there for you...
Because now...
You're coming back to me...
And you recognize the love that was once there...
But I found somebody else...
It's too late...I'm sorry...

You should have known that I loved you
You should have seen it in my eyes
Should have allowed yourself to
Believe in love, and recognize
That my love, it wasn't going nowhere
Noone but you was in my heart
And I can't believe that you would push your love aside
Baby...

[Chorus:]
It's too bad
You missed out on me
And it's so sad
Sad that you're gone away
And I'm sorry
That you missed out on me
But it's too late
You let my love slip away

And you should have known that I was open
You should have seen it in my smile
Should have allowed yourself to be adult, instead of a child
But you are the one with insecurities
You tried to put the blame on me
You never knew that my love was really here to stay
And now it is...

[Chorus:]
Baby tell me how...
Baby how could you
Let our, love, fade away
But you never knew
I cared for you, and that I loved you
And you never, gave me
Your everything
This love was not for you
And Baby...

[Chorus x2]
You should have known that I loved you
You should have seen it in my eyes
So sorry, but you let my love slip away
You should have known that I was open
You should have seen it in my smile
So sorry, but...

[Chorus:]
