Oh, baby blankets, and baby shoes, baby slippers, baby spoons, walls of baby blue;
Dream child in my head is a nightmare born in a borrowed bed...
Now I know lightning strikes again...
It struck me once, then struck me dead;
My folly grows inside of me....

I eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two, now...
Walk for two, eat for two, breathe for two, now...

Well, the egg man fell down off his shelf - all the good King's men, with all their help
Struggled 'til the end for a shell they couldn't mend....
You know where this will lead;
To hush and rock in the nursery
For the kicking one inside of me...

I eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two, now...
Eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two, now...

When the boy was a boy, the girl was a girl, they found each other in a wicked world;
Strong in some respects, but she couldn't stand for the way he begged
And gave in - Pride is for men;
Young girls should run and hide instead...
Risk the game by taking dares with "yes"...

Eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two, now...
Eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two, now...

Walk for two? I'm stumbling...
Walk for two? I'm stumbling...
Breathe for two, how? I can't breathe...
I can't breathe...

Five months, how it grows;
Five months now, I begin to show ...
