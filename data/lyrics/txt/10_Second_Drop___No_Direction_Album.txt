I
Need to question why
Voices in my mind
Leave the doubt behind
This part of life
Its just those little things that
Always make us cry
I'm not buyin' what they're sellin'
Don't believe the lies they're tellin'
Can't find a reason nothing we're knowing
Won't someone tell us where are we going now
These long-forgotten dreams
Silenced from our screams
Never to be seen
An' still we try
We're always doin' what we have to
Make it by
I'm not buyin' what they're sellin'
Don't believe the lies they're tellin'
Can't find a reason nothing we're knowing
Won't someone tell us where are we going now
Where are we going now
With no direction
This part of life
Its just those little things that
Always make us cry
I'm not buyin' what they're sellin'
Don't believe the lies they're tellin'
Can't find a reason nothing we're knowing
Won't someone tell us where are we going now
Where are we going now
With no direction
No direction now X3
With no direction
