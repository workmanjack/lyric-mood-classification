It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real

I was sick of all the pain
Tired of all the shame that I felt
But you showed me a way
To never have a doubt
And always to believe in myself
Now I see

It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real

Now I'm breathin for the first time
And I'm leavin, all this behind
I've become, what I am because of you
It was you

I'm so sorry 'bout the ways
But I can't take away my past
But you love me anyway
And now I wanna do
Everything for you that I can
Even though it won't erase
The foolish things that I've done
Things that blinded me
But now I see

It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real

Now I'm breathin for the first time
And I'm leavin, all this behind
And I'll stand
For what I know is real

So how can I make this up to you
I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive
Now now that I'm living my life for you
I'll fight and I'll push and I'll Strive
Can't you see

It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real

Now I'm breathin for the first time
And I'm leavin, all this behind
I've become, what I am because of you
It was you

I can see the writing on the wall
As time begins to crawl away from me
And I've become what I am
Because of you
It was you
