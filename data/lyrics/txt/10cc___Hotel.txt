[Intro]
On de' ub'er side ob' de' island
'Dere's a sky so clear and blue
Can see, cross water, to de' mainland
New life for me and you

[Chorus]
Let's buy a hotel
Let's get a yacht
We'll get a golden island in the sun made of coconut
Let's buy an old car
We'll crash in a hut
We'll feed the food to the Ford and we'll live off the coconut
Well there's a big black mama in a tree
She's gonna cook us
She's gonna call up the rest of the tribe
And it looks like the ghost of Tarzan lied
He went over to the other side
And he rang like a bell from tree to tree

[Verse]
They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go
We get American menus
With all American men
We're getting sick of things American
We ate our way through half the Pentagon
We had our share of big palookas
Yankee go home
Yankee go home
They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go
Yankee go home
Yankee go ho ho home

[Chorus]
Let's buy a hotel
Let's get a yacht
We'll get a golden island in the sun made of coconut
Let's buy an old car
We'll crash in a hut
We'll feed the food to the Ford and we'll live off the coconut
Well there's a big black mama in a tree
She's gonna cook us
She's gonna call up the rest of the tribe
And it looks like the ghost of Tarzan lied
He went over to the other side
And he rang like a bell from tree to tree
Tree to tree, tree to tree

[Outro]
They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go
