The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
Take a look around
We're quick to laugh when they've got troubles (ooh ooh)
And we put 'em down
We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion
On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin'
She may be quiet
She may be shy
But don't you bring her down
Don't pass her by
The world of wisdom behind her eyes
Could answer everything
But you and I
We seem to wander in a daydream (ooh ooh)
We never look around
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
And we put 'em down
We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion
On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin'
She's not beautiful
But don't make it plain
You underestimate
It's not a game
A heart of gold
Behind the drab
Would comfort anyone
But you and I
Should try to see it from the other side, mmm, mmm
We'll get a shock
It could surprise you
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
Take a look around
We set the pace while others listen (ooh ooh)
Never make a sound
The rain must fall
But we can change
Our understanding
Will remain
So take a moment
To wonder why
The world keeps turning
For you and I
