Shall we agree that just this once
I'm gonna change my life
Until it's just as tiny or
Important as you like
And in time, we won't even recall that we spoke
Words that turned out to be as big as smoke
Like smoke, disappears in the air
There's always something smouldering somewhere

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh, it sure made a difference to me
You'll see me off in the distance, I hope
At the other end
At the other end of the telescope

There was a time not long ago
I dreamt that the world was flat
And all the colours bled away
And that was that
And in time, I could only believe in one thing
The sky was just phosphourus stars hung on strings
And you swore that they'd always be mine
When you can pull them down anytime

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh, it sure made a difference to me
You'll see me off in the distance, I hope
At the other end
At the other end of the telescope

There, there baby now, don't say a word
Lie down, baby, your vision is blurred
Your head is so sore from all of that thinking
I don't want to hurt you now
But I think you're shrinking (I think you're shrinking)

You're half-naked ambition and
You're half out of your wits
And though your wristwatch always works
Your necktie never fits
Now it's so hard to pick the receiver up
And when I call, I never noticed you could be so small
The answer was under your nose
But the question never arose

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh, it sure made a difference to me
When you find me here at the end of my rope
When the head and heart of it finally elope
You can see us off in the distance, I hope
At the other end
At the other end of the telescope
