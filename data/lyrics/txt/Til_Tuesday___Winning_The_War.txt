You fight just for the sake of it
You know what hurts the most
You might have once been faking it
But not it cuts too close
Winning the war
And losing every battle
You close the door
On happy ever after
We should have stopped it long ago
When there was love still
But we would give in to ego
And never stop until
Winning the war
And losing every battle
You close the door
On happy ever after
I know, you know
Winning the war
Is not winning at all
I know, you know
Winning the war
Is not winning at all
Winning the war
And losing every battle
You close the door
On happy ever after
