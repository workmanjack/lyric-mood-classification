Digging deeper in my mind, can't get you out of my head
There's no way to describe, just how you make me feel
I don't know is it love, I have lost control
Even when I'm gone, I can't get away

I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice, that I can't focus?

Like the moth fly's to the light, catch it at first sight
I can't deny, I'm taken by the beauty in your eye's
I don't know is it love, I have lost control
Even when I'm gone, I can't get away

I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice, that I can't focus?

I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice?
Do you notice?
I can't focus, when I'm near you
Do you notice, me at all?
I can't focus, when I hear you
Do you notice, that I can't focus?
