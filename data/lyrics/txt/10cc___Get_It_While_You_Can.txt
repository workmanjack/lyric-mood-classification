You've got to get it while you can
Time and time we've gone no man
Tomorrow will become today
It's there to take it if you try
Everybody's having fun
So why be the one
Who's out in the cold

Don't let the future pass you by
Go ahead and give it a try
You've got to fight for number one
You see the story's just begun
Everybody's having fun
So why be the one
Who's got to be told

By the time you get to something
You'll see the writing on the wall
You're living in the land of maybe
Tomorrow never comes at all

From times remembered and the times in between
You'll find you're living your life in a dream
